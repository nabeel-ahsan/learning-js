// Declare a constant variable called 'accountId' and assign it the value 144553
const accountId = 144553;

// Declare a variable called 'accountEmail' and assign it the string value "john@google.com"
let accountEmail = "john@google.com";

// Declare a variable called 'accountPassword' and assign it the string value "12345"
var accountPassword = "12345"; // Using 'var' here is not preferred due to scope issues.

// Assign the string value "London" to a variable called 'accountCity'
accountCity = "London"; // 'accountCity' becomes a global variable because it wasn't declared with a keyword 'const', 'let', or 'var'.

// Declare a variable called 'accountState' without assigning any value to it yet
let accountState;

// Reassign the value of 'accountEmail' to "hc@hc.com"
accountEmail = "hc@hc.com";

// Reassign the value of 'accountPassword' to "21212121"
accountPassword = "21212121";

// Reassign the value of 'accountCity' to "Madrid"
accountCity = "Madrid";

// Output the value of 'accountId' to the console
console.log(accountId);

// Output a table to the console displaying the values of all variables
console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity, accountState]);


/* 

Additional notes:

const is used for values that should not be reassigned.

let is used for variables that might change their value later in the code.

var is an older way of declaring variables and has scoping issues, so it's better to avoid it in modern JavaScript.

Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in the code, but it's generally considered better practice to limit their use to prevent unintended side effects.
