HTML Structure:
The HTML document defines a basic structure containing various elements like headings, paragraphs, an input field, and an unordered list.

Element Selection:
Elements can be selected using various methods such as by tag name, class name, or ID.
For example, the <h1> element with the ID "title" can be selected using document.getElementById("title").

DOM Manipulation:
Once an element is selected, its properties and contents can be manipulated using JavaScript.
For instance, you can change the text content of an element using element.textContent = "New Text".

CSS Classes:
CSS classes can be applied to elements to style them uniformly.
In the provided code, the .bg-black class is applied to the body element, giving it a black background and white text color.

Event Handling:
JavaScript can be used to attach event listeners to elements, enabling interaction with the webpage.
For example, you can add a click event listener to a button element to perform an action when it's clicked.

Element Hierarchy:
The DOM represents the structure of HTML elements in a hierarchical manner.
Parents, children, and siblings of elements can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript.

Visibility:
Elements can be hidden or shown using CSS properties like display or visibility.
In the provided code, a <span> element with style="display: none;" is initially hidden from view.

Forms and Input Fields:
HTML forms and input fields allow user input and interaction.
In the provided code, an input field of type "password" is included.

Lists:
Lists in HTML are represented by <ul> (unordered list) and <li> (list item) elements.
Each <li> element inside a <ul> represents an item in the list.
